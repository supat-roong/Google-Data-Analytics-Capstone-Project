In this project, I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,\nmy team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Business Task\nFrom the scenario, lets define our business task (i.e. the goal of this anaysis). We know that the company believes that the income from annual memberships is much better than casual user. Thus, they want to increase the number of annual memberships using our anaysis insights. So we should deliver some insights that describe each types of user behavior and trend. Hence, the question I would ask for this goal is\n> What are the charateristics of annual members and casual riders?\n\n> How to increase the number of annual memberships? \n\n> Is there any potential to convert casual user to annual memberships user?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Dataset\nI will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends from [the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data](http://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

These are my recommendations below.\n* Offer weekend pass and 2-hour-ride package deals\n* Promote casual ride campaign around Streeter Dr & Grand Ave station\n\nLastly, we can improve bike allocation efficency with the time and location usage data.\n* Provide more bikes for member user around shore area in the weekday\n* Provide more bikes for casual user in weekend afternoon at Streeter Dr & Grand Ave station area\n\nThat is the end of my report, thank you for your reading.","metadata":{}}]}
