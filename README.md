# Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Project
My first data analytics project based on a case study given by Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course.

In this report, I included following deliverables:
1. A clear statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of analysis
5. Supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Top three recommendations based on the analysis
